# Invasion
A space invaders type game created entirely in Python using the Pygame module.

This game simulates the classic *Space Invaders* arcade game. Users are given three lives, which is presented at the top left corner of the screen, and are tasked with destroying enemy ships before their ship is hit or the enemy ships hit the bottom of the screen. This game will also keep tabs on the user's current score and will also remember the highest score for that play session. Once every ship is gone from the screen, the game will reset and speed of the enemy ships will increase in speed by ten percent and the point value per destroyed ship will increase by 50% of the current score value for that level.
